# Writeepi
Simple, accessible but powerful all-in-one word-processing and organization app for writers

## Story
I needed a simple writing tool that allowed me to save in a format that was easy to manage and secure, with some features for organizing by chapter and scene, managing locations and characters, and taking notes by context.
I've also integrated the ability to build pdf and epub3 files, so that in the future it will be able to easily generate an editor file.

I strayed a little from the original vision of “all cloud” but free for all, then decided to move the application to a desktop version and above all to open source so that it could easily be used offline. What's more, feedback from users will help to produce a quality software more quickly.

The content generated by the application can be very important for its author, so backup management is at the heart of the project.
